5.3. Speech and Person Recognition
The robot has to identify unknown people and answer questions about them and the environment.

5.3.1. Focus
This test focuses on human detection, sound localization, speech recognition, and robot interaction with unknown people.

5.3.2. Setup
1. Location: One room of the arena is used for this test.1.
2. Crowd: There is a crowd of 5 to 10 people in the designated room. People may be standing, sitting, lying, and in any pose.
3. Doors: All doors of the apartment are open, except for the entry door.

5.3.3. Task
â€¢ Start: The robot starts at a designated starting position and announces it wants to play riddles.
â€¢ Waiting and turn: After stating that it wants to play a riddle game, the robot waits for 10 seconds while a crowd is merged on it's back. 
  When the time elapses, the robot must turn around (about 180Â°) and nd the crowd.
â€¢ Requesting an operator: After turning around, the robot must state the size of the crowd (male and female count) and request for an operator (e.g. who want to play riddles
  with me?). The crowd will move and surround the robot, letting the operator to stand in front of the robot.
â€¢ The riddle game: Standing in front of the robot, the operator will ask 5 questions from the list.
  The robot must answer the question without asking conrmation. Questions will only be asked only once; no repetitions are allowed.
â€¢ The blind man's blu game: A random person from the crowd surrounding the robot will ask a question. The robot may
	{ Turn towards the person who asked the question and answer the question
	{ Directly answer the question without turning
	{ Turn towards the person and ask them to repeat the question
  The game will end when the 6th question has been made, following the same distribution as in the riddle game. The robot must answer the question without asking conrmation.
  Questions may be repeated once.
â€¢ Leave: The robot leaves the room through the designated door.

5.3.4. Additional rules and remarks
â€¢ Bypassing ASR: Bypassing Automated Speech Recognition via the CONTINUE rule (Section Section 3.9.1) is not allowed during this test.
â€¢ Asked questions: The distribution of questions to be randomly asked is a follows:
	{ One is a predened question
	{ Between one and two are about the arena and its status
	{ Between one and two are about the crowd
	{ Between one and two are about the list of ocial objects
  Question examples see Appendix Section A.
â€¢ Distance to the robot: The distance between each person and the robot must be between 0.75 and 1.0 meters away from the robot position (See Figure 5.2). In the riddle
  game the operator shall be between -60 and 60 from the robot's center (front range).
â€¢ Precise turning: When the robot nishes turning toward an operator, it must be clear that the robot is facing the person who made the question.
â€¢ Question repetition: In the blind man's blu game, if the robot asks for repetition, it should be done clear and loud, and after the robot has ended turning.
â€¢ Question timeout: If the robot does not answer within 10 seconds, the question is considered as missed, and referee will proceed with the next one.
â€¢ Standing still operators Operators are not allowed to move to or turn towards the robot or shout to the robot.
â€¢ Water-clear answers: If the referee is unable to hear or understand the robot's answer, the question is considered as incorrect. Single-word and short answers should be avoided
