5.4. General Purpose Service Robot
This test evaluates the abilities of the robot that are required throughout the set of tests in
stage I of this and previous years' RuleBooks. In this test the robot has to solve multiple tasks
upon request. That is, the test is not incorporated into a (predened) story and there is neither
a predened order of tasks nor a predened set of actions. The actions that are to be carried
out by the robot are chosen randomly by the referees from a larger set of actions. These actions
are organized in three categories with dierent complexity. Scoring thereby depends on the
complexity class.
5.4.1. Focus
This test particularly focuses on the following aspects:
 No predened order of actions to carry out (to get away from state machine-like behavior
programming).
 Increased complexity in speech recognition.
 Environmental (high-level) reasoning.
 Ecient and fast task execution (speed).
5.4.2. Task
1. Entering and command retrieval: The robot enters the arena and drives to a designated
position where it has to wait for further commands.
2. Command generation: A command is generated randomly, depending on the command
category chosen by the team (see below).
3. Command categories: The team may choose from the following three categories:
3.1. Category I: Tasks with a low diculty degree.
3.2. Category II: Tasks with a moderate diculty degree.
3.3. Category III: Tasks with a high diculty degree or with incomplete/erroneous
information.
4. Task assignment: The robot is given the command by the operator and may directly
start to work on the task assignment.
5. Returning to the operator: After accomplishing the assigned task, the robot has to
move back to the operator to retrieve the next command (i.e., go back to 1. without the
need of re-entering the arena). The robot can work on at most three commands. After
the third command, it has to leave the arena.
6. Exiting the arena: After accomplishing the assigned task, the robot has to leave the
arena.
The robot must must prove it has understood the given command by repeating it (Please
see the remarks about this in section 5.4.3).
5.4.3. Additional rules and remarks
1. Referees: Since the score system in this test involves a subjective evaluation of the robot's
behavior, the referees are EC/TC members.

2. Category selection: For every of the three commands given to the robot, the team
chooses the desired command category.
3. Operator:
 The person operating the robot is one of the referees (default operator).
 If the robot appears to consistently not be able to understand the operator, the
referees ask the team to continue with a custom operator or apply the CONTINUE
rule (Section 3.8.15).
 With the custom operator, the team can only score 50% of the points for the respective
command.
4. Retrieving the command: The robot must show it has understood the given command
by repeating the command (i.e. stating all the required information to accomplish the
task.).
5.4.4. Referee and OC instructions
2h before test:
 Specify and announce the entrance and exit door
